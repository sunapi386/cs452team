/**
Name. Create - instantiate a task.
Synopsis. int Create( int priority, void (*code) ( ) )
Description. Create allocates and initializes a task descriptor, using the given
priority, and the given function pointer as a pointer to the entry point of
executable code, essentially a function with no arguments and no return value.
When Create returns the task descriptor has all the state needed to run the task,
the task’s stack has been suitably initialized, and the task has been entered into
its ready queue so that it will run the next time it is scheduled.
Returns.
    tid: positive integer task id of the newly created task. The task id must be
    unique, in the sense that no task has, will have or has had the same task id.
    -1 : error(s) occured
Do rough tests to ensure that the function pointer argument is valid.

Name. MyParentTid - find the task id of the task that created the running
task.
Synopsis. int MyParentTid( )
Description. MyParentTid returns the task id of the task that created the calling task.
This will be problematic only if the task has exited or been destroyed, in which
case the return value is implementation-dependent.
Returns.
    MyParentTidtid: the task id of the task that created the calling task.

Synopsis. void Pass( )
Description. Pass causes a task to stop executing. The task is moved to the end
of its priority queue, and will resume executing when next scheduled.

Name. Exit - terminate execution forever. Synopsis. void Exit( )
Description. Exit causes a task to cease execution permanently. It is removed
from all priority queues, send queues, receive queues and awaitEvent queues.

Returns. Exit does not return. If a point occurs where all tasks have exited the
kernel should return cleanly to RedBoot.

AwaitEvent - block until event with eventType
Description. AwaitEvent blocks until the event identified by eventid occurs then returns.
The following details are implementation-dependent.
• the kernel does not collects volatile data, and does not re-enables the interrupt.
• interrupts are enabled when AwaitEvent returns.
• at most one task to block on a single event.
Returns.
• volatile data – in the form of a positive integer.
• 0 – volatile data is in the event buffer.
• -1 – invalid event.
• -2 – corrupted volatile data. Error indication in the event buffer.
• -3 – volatile data must be collected and interrupts re-enabled in the
caller.
